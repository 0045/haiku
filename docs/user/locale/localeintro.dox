\page locale_intro Introduction to the Locale Kiit

The Locale Kit provides a set of tools for internationalizing, localizing and
translating your software. This includes not only replacing string with their
translations at runtime, but also more complex tasks such as formating numbers,
dates, and times in a way that match the locale preferences of the user.
