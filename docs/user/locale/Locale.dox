\ingroup locale
\brief Class for representing a locale and its settings

A locale is defined by the combination of a country and a language. Using these
two informations, it is possible to determine the format to use for date, time,
and number formatting. The BLocale class also provide collators, which allows
you to sort a list of strings properly depending on a set of rules about
accented chars and other special cases that vary over the different locales.

\fn const BCollator* Collator() const
\brief Returns the collator associated to this locale

Returns the collator in use for this locale, allowing you to use it to sort a
set of strings.

*/

/*!
\fn const BCountry* Country() const
\brief Returns the country associated to this locale

A locale is defined by the combination of a country and a language. This
method gets the country part of this information, so you can access the
data that is not language-dependant (such as the country flag).

/*!
\fn const BLanguage* Language() const
\brief Returns the language associated to this locale

/*!
\fn int StringCompare(const char* s1, const char* s2) const
\fn int StringCompare(const BString* s1, const BString* s2) const
\brief Compares two strings using the locale's collator

These methods are short-hands to Collator()->StringCompare.

/*!
\fn void GetSortKey(const char* string, BString* key) const
\brief Computes the sort key of a string

This method is a short-hand to Collator()->GetSortKey.
