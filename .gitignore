# HFS+ uses NFD and automatically converts NFC to NFD, while the file name in
# the repository uses NFC. So when git looks for the file, it does find it
# (because NFC gets converted to NFD), but when it checks for files not in the
# repository, it finds the file name in NFD and can't match it to the file name
# in NFC.
#
# WARNING: The following line MUST use NFD, DO NOT convert it to NFD!
